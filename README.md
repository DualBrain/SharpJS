# About SharpJS

SharpJS is open-source software licensed under the GPLv3, which can be found in the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file.
If you feel restricted by the license, please purchase a commercial license from [the marketplace]( http://exaphaser.binpress.com/product/sharpjs/3760#pricing). (You could do this if you wanted to use the software, for example, for some kind of proprietary use. The pricing is very affordable and there are multiple tiers.)

The runtime is powered by JSIL, an application that translates compiled IL to JavaScript. The SharpJS frameworks are built on top of JSIL and provide classes for building web applications that run in the browser.

# Getting Started
My friend [daveho8888](https://github.com/daveho8888) and I, [0xFireball](https://github.com/0xFireball) have put together [samples and code demos for getting started with SharpJS](https://github.com/ZetaPhase/SharpJS-Demos). `daveho8888` has also put together lots of code with explanation to help even a beginner get started with SharpJS. The **[wiki of this project](https://github.com/exaphaser/SharpJS/wiki)** will contain information about this project, and on extending the project with your own APIs, and build instructions.

# Currently supported APIs and Frameworks:
- **ExaPhaser.WebForms** - A GUI framework for creating HTML5 applications styled with modern CSS frameworks such as Foundation and Bootstrap.
- **SharpJS.Dom** - A set of extensions that provide JavaScript and jQuery bindings to C# for manipulating DOM from the .NET runtime.
